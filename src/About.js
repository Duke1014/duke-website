                    <p>I tried my hand at game development with friends working on an emulated server of EverQuest. Since then, I found myself learning more languages and programming principles, leading me to take on Flatiron School. From there, I learned that developing can be more expansive than creating a game, but even creating the web tools to create and maintain apps is essential and rewarding to build.</p>
